## Question 1 - Programming
_We're looking at your programming ability. It must not only work, it should be maintainable._

Let us assume you are a crypto investor. You have made transactions over a period of time which is logged in a CSV file at the [data directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Propine/2b-boilerplate/master/data/transactions.csv). Write a command line program that returns the latest portfolio value per token in USD

The program should be ran like this

```
npm run start
```

On running, it should return the latest portfolio value per token in USD

The CSV file has the following columns
 - timestamp: Integer number of seconds since the Epoch
 - transaction_type: Either a DEPOSIT or a WITHDRAWAL
 - token: The token symbol
 - amount: The amount transacted

Portfolio means the balance of the token where you need to add deposits and subtract withdrawals. You may obtain the exchange rates from [cryptocompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation) where the API is free. You should write it in Node.js as our main stack is in Javascript/Typescript and we need to assess your proficiency.
